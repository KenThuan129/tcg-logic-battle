# IT Colloseum

IT Colloseum is a tactical card battle game where players command their headquarters (HQ) in strategic combat against AI opponents or other players. Build custom decks, manage resources, and outmaneuver your enemies in this turn-based strategy game.

## Game Overview

### Core Gameplay

Players engage in tactical card battles where the goal is to reduce the enemy HQ's health to zero while protecting your own. Each player starts with:
- **HQ Health Points (HP)**: Your headquarters' life total
- **Mana System**: A resource that regenerates each turn, used to play cards
- **Deck & Hand**: A collection of cards drawn each turn (max 7 in hand)
- **Roles**: Players can be either an **Attacker** (offensive focus) or **Defender** (defensive focus)

### Card System

The game features three card types with distinct roles:

- **🔴 Red Cards (Attack)**: Deal damage to enemy HQ with various flavors like burst, lifesteal, damage-over-time (DoT), and shield-bypass attacks
- **🟡 Yellow Cards (Defense)**: Protect your HQ with blocking, deflection, healing, cleanse effects, and debuff immunity
- **🟢 Green Cards (Utility)**: Support your strategy with buffs, debuffs, card draw, and healing

Cards have mana costs, value ratings, and special effects. The game includes multiple deck archetypes like:
- Firewall Guardian
- Quantum Burst
- Pulse Vanguard
- Shadow Infiltrator

### Special Mechanics

- **Sigils**: Build up Overload or Override sigils by meeting specific conditions to unlock powerful effects
- **Turn-Based Combat**: Strategic resource management and timing are crucial for victory
- **Adaptive AI**: PvE opponents scale in difficulty and adapt to your playstyle

### Game Modes

1. **PvE Skirmish**: Battle against adaptive AI commanders at various difficulty levels. Perfect for testing decks, practicing combos, and honing your strategy.

2. (Future Development) **PvP Colosseum**: Enter online multiplayer matches through Supabase-powered lobbies. Host public or private rooms, invite friends, and compete in real-time synchronized battles.

## Getting Started

Visit `http://localhost:3000` and sign in to start playing!

## Project Structure

- `/app` - Next.js app directory with pages and components
  - `/components` - React components (GameBoard, Card, Hand, HQPanel, etc.)
  - `/lib` - Game engine logic and utilities
  - `/store` - Zustand state management
- `/supabase` - Database schema and migrations
- `/components/ui` - Reusable UI components (shadcn/ui)

## Development

The game engine handles turn logic, card effects, mana systems, and game state synchronization. State is managed centrally with Zustand, making it easy to support both local PvE and synchronized PvP matches.

### Key Systems

- **Game Engine** (`lib/gameEngine.ts`): Core game logic for card actions and turn processing
- **Game Store** (`store/gameStore.ts`): Centralized state management for game sessions
- **Card System** (`lib/cards/pool.ts`): Card definitions and archetypes
- **PvP Sync** (`app/components/OfflineShell.tsx`): Real-time match synchronization via Supabase

## Deployment

When deploying to production (e.g., Vercel):

1. Set the Supabase environment variables in your deployment platform
2. Ensure Realtime is enabled for the `matches` table in Supabase
3. Keep `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` as an encrypted server-side secret (never expose to client)
